# [Pellet](http://.github.io/pellet)

Demo project for Vevo + San Francisco ReactJS meetup

## Installation
```

I have also included a simple shell script to make walking throw the demo easy. Just include the ./bin/git-demo into your path or copy the script to your ~/bin /usr/local/bin etc.

```
$ git demo
```

start the project

```
$ git demo 3
